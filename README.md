## Micro Focus Operations Orchestration on the AWS Cloud

This Quick Start automatically deploys Micro Focus Operations Orchestration (OO) Central and Workflow Designer 2018.12 in a new or existing virtual private cloud (VPC) on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud in about 20 minutes. The Quick Start includes AWS CloudFormation templates and a deployment guide with step-by-step instructions.

Micro Focus OO is a system to create and use actions in structured sequences called flows.

These structured sequences enable seamless automation and orchestration of repeatable IT operations across teams, tools, and environments, such as:
- Maintaining, troubleshooting, and repairing IT resources.
- Conducting health checks; diagnosing and repairing networks, servers, software applications, and workstations.
- Automating elements, runbooks, and business services.
