## Micro Focus Operations Orchestration on the AWS Cloud

This Quick Start automatically deploys Micro Focus Operations Orchestration Central and Workflow Designer 2018.12 in a new or existing virtual private cloud (VPC) on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud in about 15 minutes. The Quick Start includes AWS CloudFormation templates and a deployment guide with step-by-step instructions.

OO is a system to create and use actions in structured sequences called flows.

These structured sequences enable seamless automation and orchestration of repeatable IT operations across teams, tools, and environments, such as:
- Maintain, troubleshoot and repair IT resources
- Health Checks, diagnose, and repair of networks, servers, software applications and workstations
- Element automation, runbook automation, integrated automation, and automation of the business services
